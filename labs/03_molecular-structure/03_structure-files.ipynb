    "The `HN` hydrogen atom attached to the `N` is often not in crystal structures because it is invisible in the diffraction experiment used to make the model.

Write a program that takes a pdb file as input, calculates the position of each `HN` atom, and then writes out a new pdb file with the `HN` atoms written out as lines just after the `N` atoms.  This means the line encoding the position of `N` for residue 46 would be followed by a new line encoding the position of `HN` for residue 46.  You do not have to renumber the atoms in the file (but bonus points if you do).  "
