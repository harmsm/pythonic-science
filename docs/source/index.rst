CH410/510 Scientific Computing
==============================

+ The class will meet Mon and Wed at 9 am 1 hr, and then Fri for 2 hr.

+ In general, Mon and Wed will be instruction days where we cover new
  programming material.  Fri will be an open "lab" where you will work on
  exercises in class.

Contact
=======

+ Mike Harms (harms@uoregon.edu)
+ Joseph Harman (jharman@uoregon.edu)

Conceptual Goals
================

By the end of the course, students should understand:

+ Basic python: data types, key words, control, functions and imports
+ Core python extensions for scientists: scipy, numpy, and jupyter
+ Strategies for dissecting problems and formulating solutions in code
+ Where to go to pick up skills in the future as the need arises

Skill Goals
===========

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

+ Write basic python programs from scratch
+ Identify existing libraries for a problem and learn how to use them
+ Generate arbitrarily complex custom plots
+ Simulate experimental sampling
+ Manipulate scientific datasets of the following types (at a basic level):
 + High-throughput sequencing data
 + Chemical structure data from databases such as the PDB
 + Images

Assignments
===========

+ Project prospectus (Due May 10)
+ `Final project <final-project.html>`_ (Due June 10)

Weekly assignments
------------------

+ There will be 8 labs.
+ We will (generally) start the labs on Fri in class.  
+ They will be due the following Wed in class. 
+ They can be turned in by email.

Grading
=======

+ Breakdown:
    + 25% attendance
    + 25% final project
    + 50% labs (6.25%/lab) 
+ Labs will be graded based on whether they are turned in, whether we can run
  the notebook, and whether they notebooks give the right results.
+ The final project will be graded according to the rubric given in the
  `Final project description <final-project.html>`_.
