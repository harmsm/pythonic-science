This repository holds the source material for a Scientific Computing course
taught at the University of Oregon.  The easiest way to access the material is
through the [course website](https://harmsm.github.io/scientific-computing).

#### Types of content in this repository:

 + **chapters**: jupyter notebooks that teach content.  These are a mixture of
   interactive notebooks and slides.
 + **labs**: jupyter notebooks that students work through as small groups.  These
   are content-based and designed to present "real" problems faced by a
   scientific programmer, largely in a molecular biology context.
 + **zips**: zipped versions of the chapters and labs.  These can be used for
   easy distribution for students not comfortable using git.
 + **reference**: jupyter notebooks with reference material germane to the course.
