# pythonic-science
Materials for Scientific Programming in Python Course at the UO

[Syllabus](https://pythonic-science.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Instructions to get rolling
 * Set up the computing environment, follow the instructions [here](https://python-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_pages/install_python.html)

 * Install git. There are a couple of options for this.  One is to install 
   command line [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
   The other option would be a [GUI client](https://desktop.github.com/). 

 * Use `git` to clone the pythonic-science repository onto a convenient place
   on your computer:
    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/harmsm/pythonic-science.git
    ```
 * Fire up `jupyter` in the `pythonic-science` directory. (You'll have to 
   specify the start up folder as described [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html)).

 * Open `Test Notebook.ipynb` by clicking on it in the jupyter window.
 * Follow the directions in that notebook to make sure everything is installed
   correctly.  It will print out any missing packages if it cannot find them.
